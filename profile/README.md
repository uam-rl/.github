# UAM Reinforcement Learning Projects

Servicio Social - Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana

## Roadmap

- **Torch-RL with OpenAI Gym**: Build foundational RL models using PyTorch and Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym)
- **Atari Game Agent**: Develop an RL system for classic Atari games
- **Transformer-based RL**: Explore RL projects integrating transformer architectures

## Research Focus

We're particularly interested in:

- **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**: The efficient RL algorithm popularized by DeepSeek that eliminates the need for a separate critic model, reducing memory and compute overhead by ~50% compared to traditional PPO
- **LoRA Fine-tuning**: Using Low-Rank Adaptation to efficiently fine-tune base models with reinforcement learning
